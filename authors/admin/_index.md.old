Since December 2019, I joined <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a> as an assistant professor, and became a faculty member of <a href="http://calab.kaist.ac.kr/">Computer Architecture and Systems Laboratory (CASys)</a>! 
I am very much looking forward to working with talented students on exciting projects. 
If you're interested in joining my research group, please apply to the graduate program of <a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">School of Computing at KAIST</a>, and contact me via email introducing yourself.<br><br>
